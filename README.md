This interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a fantastic addition to my GitHub repository. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a user-friendly web-based experience for playing the classic hand game against a computer opponent. The game features smooth animations and a dynamic scoreboard to track wins, losses, and ties.
